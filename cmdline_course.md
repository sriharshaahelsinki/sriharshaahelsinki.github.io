- **Week 1**: This section's topic was the introduction to the command line. I had some prior knowledge before taking this course, but this section reinforced the concepts behind the command line. Those being what the purpose of continuing to use a command line interface, and a bit of understanding of what a Unix terminal actually means.

- **Week 2**: This section's topic was navigating a UNIX file system. I knew a bit already, such as using the commands _cd_, _ls_, etc. However, connecting to remote servers was a new concept to me. I didn't realize how easy it was to connect to a remote server right from the terminal.

- **Week 3**: This section's topic was basic text processing. Learning how to use regular expressions in this unit made me realize how powerful using the terminal could be, as it made it a lot more efficient to edit and delete files in bulk.

- **Week 4**: This section's topic was advanced text processing. I learned about how to use the **sed** command to search through large samples of text. It was a step up above from what was done in the previous week.

- **Week 5**: This section's topic was scripting. I learned about how to create _bash_ scripts. The syntax behind creating bash scripts took effort to grasp, as I found it less intuitive than coding with Python.

- **Week 6**: This section's topic was installing packages. I learned about different package managers in the terminal, such as `apt`, as well as other ones like `pip` for installing Python packages...

- **Week 7**: This section's topic was version control. I learned a lot about **GitHub**, including how to build a repository, connect my local system to Git, and how to add, commit, and push my changes...

## Table of helpful terminal commands:

| File navigation | Text processing | Git |
| ----------------|-----------------|-----|

| ls		| sed		| commit |
| rm		| tr		| push |
